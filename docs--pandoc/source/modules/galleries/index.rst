Galleries Module 
================

The galleries module allows you to quickly create and upload image sets that can then be embedded into your website using the galleries plugin.

Adding Images
#############

To quickly add multiple images click the "Add Images" button at the top right. This will open the image manager where you can view and select images that are currently on the server. To upload images from your local computer to the server click on "Upload" and select the images to upload.

Once uploaded to the server you can then add multiple images to the galley at once by holding ctrl and left clicking on each image you would like to add. This will highlight each image. Then right click and choose "Select". You will then see your images added to the gallery.
