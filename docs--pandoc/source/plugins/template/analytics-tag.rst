 
Analytics Tag
=============

Outputs the Google Analytics javascript tracker using the analytic data provided in the general settings of the site admin panel. Place this tag just before the closing ``</head>`` tag of your theme.

.. code-block:: php 

    {{ template:analytics }}

.. note:: You do not need to use this tag if you are using the Head Tag, as this is included in its output.
