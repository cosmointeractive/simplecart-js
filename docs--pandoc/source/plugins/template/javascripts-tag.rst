JavaScript Tag
==============

Outputs the javascript includes array built from the Add Javascript Tag. Place this tag in between the ``<head>`` ``</head>`` tags of your theme.

.. code-block:: php 

    {{ template:javascripts }}

.. note:: You do not need to use this tag if you are using the **Head Tag**, as this is included in its output.
