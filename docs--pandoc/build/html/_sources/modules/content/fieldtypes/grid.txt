Introduction
#####

The Grid field in PageStudioCMS provides a way to group fieldtypes in repeatable rows. This is useful for when you need to group a subset of data in your channel entry form that may or may not have a varying number of rows. You can select a minimum and a maximum amount of rows to allow data entry for, or it can be virtually infinite.

Field Options
######

Minimum Rows
-------

Specifies the minimum number of rows this Grid will have. For example, if you enter 3, the publish form will load with three rows ready to be populated and will not allow the publisher to have less than three rows in this Grid field.

Maximum Rows
-------

Specifies the maximum number of rows this Grid can have. For example, if you enter 10, the publish form will not allow the publisher to add any more than ten rows to this Grid field.

Grid Fields
-------

Here, you specify the columns you want in your Grid field. All native fieldtypes are available to add and have many of the same configuration options as full fields do.
