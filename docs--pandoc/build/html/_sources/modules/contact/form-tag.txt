Usage
#####

Builds and processes a simple contact form that when submitted is emailed to the notification email specified in the general settings of the CMS.

.. code-block:: php
    
    {{ contact:form required="name|email|phone|message" }}

By default the single {{ contact:form }} tag will return a simple form with the following fields:

- Name
- Email
- Phone
- Message
- Captcha Image (Captcha parameter required)
- Captcha Input (Captcha parameter required)

Tag Block
#########

To be much more flexible you can use the form tag as a tag block and define your own contact form with any kind of formatting you would like.

.. code-block:: php

    {{ contact:form required="first_name|last_name|email" captcha="true" }}
        <div>
            <label for="first_name">First Name:</label>
            <input id="first_name" name="first_name" />
        </div>
        <div>
            <label for="last_name">Last Name:</label>
            <input id="last_name" name="last_name" />
        </div>
        <div>
            <label for="email">Email:</label>
            <input id="email" name="email" />
        </div>
        <div>
            Please enter the characters below:<br />
            {{ captcha }}<br />
            {{ captcha_input }}
        </div>
        <div>
            <input type="submit" value="Send" />
        </div>
    {{ /contact:form }}

.. note:: The html <form> tags will automatically be added upon rendering.

Spam Prevention
###############

To help prevent bots from spamming an additional input field is added to your form that is hidden using CSS. The theory is that majority of bots do not render CSS and will attempt to auto fill the hidden field. When the form is processed it will check to ensure this field is empty before sending the email. If you need additional spam protection see the captcha parameter.
