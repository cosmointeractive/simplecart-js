Metadata Tag
============

Outputs the ``title``, ``meta keywords``, and ``meta description`` of each page. Place this tag in between near the top of the ``<head>`` ``</head>`` tags of your theme template.

.. code-block:: php
 
    {{ template:metadata }}

.. note:: You do not need to use this tag if you are using the **Head Tag**, as this is included in its output.
